# Introduction
   1. Purpose of this User's Guide
   - This User's Guide provides an overview of the MRO Mission Data Dictionary. It details how to include the dictionary in a PDS4 label, describes the organization of classes and attributes, provides definitions of the classes and attributes, and lists examples of labels that use it.
   2. Audience
   - This User's Guide should be useful to data providers intending to archive MRO data with PDS as well as PDS Nodes who are working with these data providers.

# Overview of the MRO Mission Data Dictionary

The MRO Mission Data Dictionary contains classes, attributes, and rules specific to the MRO mission and its instruments. 
Steward: Jennifer Ward, PDS Geosciences Node, geosci@wunder.wustl.edu

# How to Include the MRO Mission Data Dictionary in a PDS4 Label

The dictionary consists of a set of files with names in the form PDS4_MRO_xxxx_yyyy.ext, where
- xxxx = the PDS4 Information Model version, e.g. 1I00 
- yyyy = the MRO Mission Dictionary version, e.g. 1300

and the file extensions are

- .csv = A comma-separated value table of dictionary attributes 
- .JSON = The dictionary contents in JSON format 
- .sch = The dictionary "rules" as an XML Schematron file 
- .txt = The report generated when the dictionary was built 
- .xml = The PDS4 label that describes this set of files 
- .xsd = The dictionary contents as an XML schema file

Only the schema and Schematron files are needed for validating a PDS4 label.

The latest version of this dictionary may be found on the PDS web site at https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/dictionaries/index-missions.shtml#mro.

The following is an example showing the use of this dictionary in a PDS4 label.

Attributes (in alphabetical order)

*activity_id*
The activity_id attribute describes the type of measurement contained in a CRISM EDR or other data product, and provides indication of how the observation is commanded. The format of the value is AC### where AC is a 2-letter designation of the type of measurement made, and ### is a 3-numeral designation of the instrument command macro that was executed to acquire the data. Macro numbers are in the range 0-255.
For EDRs, BI is measurement of detector bias, DF is a measurement of background including dark current and thermal background, LP is measurement of a focal plane lamp, SP is measurement of the internal integrating sphere, and SC is measurement of an external scene. TP indicates that the EDR contains any test pattern produced by instrument electronics. T1 through T7 specify the test pattern, test pattern 1 through test pattern 7. UN indicates that the EDR contains data in which housekeeping does not match the commanded instrument configuration.
For an RDR, RA indicates that the file contains values in units of radiance (W m^-2 nm^-1 sr^-1). IF indicates that the file contains values in units of I/F, or radiance divided by solar flux scaled for heliocentric distance.  AL indicates that the file contains values as estimated Labert albedo, which is I/F corrected for cosine of incidence angle and for atmospheric and thermal effects.  SU indicates that the files contains summary parameters, unitless values derived from Lambert albedo.
For an RDR or a DDR, DE indicates that the files contains derived values related to observation geometry or independently characterized properties of the scene.

If x1 and xn are the first and last sampling parameter values, respectively, xn is larger than x1, n is the number of sampling parameters, the caret symbol (^) denotes exponentiation, and b, a positive real number, is the base for exponentiation, then the value of sampling_parameter_interval is: (xn-x1)/(n-1) (for sampling_parameter_scale = Linear), (xn/x1)^(1/(n-1)) (for sampling_parameter_scale = Logarithmic), (b^xn-b^x1)/(n-1) (for sampling_parameter_scale = Exponential).

*array_scale*
The array_scale attribute specifies whether the sampling interval is linear or something other such as logarithmic.

  - Linear - Values of Uniformly Sampled are given at uniform (linear) spacings of an independent variable - for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
  - Exponential - The values of the independent variable in exponential uniformly sampled data are given at uniform spacing of the exponential of some base b, a positive real number. That is, for independent variable x in the range [x1, xn], the sampling points xj satisfy: b^xj = b^x1 + (j-1)(b^xn - b^x1)/(n-1) for j = 1 ... n where the caret symbol (^) denotes exponentiation. For example, if the independent variable has values 0., 0.30103, 0.47712, 0.60206, ... and the base is 10, then the Exponential Uniformly Spaced data are given at 10^0., 10^0.30103, 10^0.47712, 10^0.60206, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
  - Logarithmic - The values of the independent variable, x, in logarithmic uniformly sampled data are given at uniform spacing of the logarithm of x in some base, b, a positive real number. That is, for independent variable x in the range [x1, xn], the sampling points xj satisfy: log_b(xj) = log_b(x1) + (j-1)(log_b(xn) - log_b(x1))/(n-1) for j = 1 ... n where log_b(x) is the log of x in base b. For example, if the independent variable has values 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... and the base is 10, then the Logarithmic Uniformly Spaced data are given at 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
